\section{Experiments results}

We implemented the distributed algorithm and compared it with~\cite{Aggarwal06achievinganonymity} and with the lower bound of $d_{r}^{\max}$ on real location data from a trajectory dataset of 9000 mobile users in Shenzen city in china. Our main observations are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Our distributed algorithm usually produces better results than the $2$-approximation algorithm of~\cite{Aggarwal06achievinganonymity}.
\item The distributed algorithm runs faster and therefore can be run on larger datasets
\item The results (maximum cluster diameters) are close to the lower bound of $d_{r}^{\max}$.
\end{itemize}

\end{center}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:comparison} shows the performance of our algorithm in comparison to~\cite{Aggarwal06achievinganonymity} and $d_{r}^{\max}$ as a baseline, on a snapshot containing $60$ random users from the dataset. 

The distributed algorithm clearly performs better than~\cite{Aggarwal06achievinganonymity} in most cases, and in fact performs close to the lower bound.

Figure~\ref{fig:large} shows results on a larger dataset of 1500 mobile users where the distributed still performs well.
