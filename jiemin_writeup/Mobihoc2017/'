\section{Experimental Results}

Shown below are examples of clusterings, for $r=10$ and $r=4$ generated by the distributed algorithm on a real-world data set.
The points depicted are a snapshot of the GPS co-ordinates of 1500 cars driving around Shenzhen city in China.

The X and Y axes in the figures above respectively denote longitude and latitude. 
For generating these clusters and other experiments on the distributed algorithm to be described next,
latitude and longitude pairs were treated simply as x,y co-ordinates in $\mathbb{R}^2$.

We have implemented this distributed algorithm (used for generating the plots above) along with
the $r-$Gather algorithm described in \cite{Aggarwal06achievinganonymity} for comparing their solution
qualities. These algorithms were coded up in Python 2.7.12 using principally, the NetworkX, NumPy, SciPy
and Matplotlib packages.



The core of the distributed algorithm involves finding a maximal independent set (MIS) over the $r$-neighborhoods
of every point in the point-cloud. Depending on the MIS algorithm used, the clusters obtained on the data-set will
be different. 




To test the quality of the clusterings generated for different $r$'s we used the following criteria.

\begin{itemize}
\item  The maximum over all clusters, the diameter of a cluster.  
\item  The maximum over all clusters, the 90th percentile of point-distances within a cluster
\end{itemize}

We implemented the distributed algorithm and compared it with~ \cite{Aggarwal06achievinganonymity}
and with the lower bound of $d_{r}^{\max}$ on real location data from a trajectory dataset of 9000
mobile users in Shenzen city in china. Our main observation are:

and with the lower bound of $d_{r}^{\max}$ on real location data from a trajectory dataset of 9000
mobile users in Shenzen city in china. Our main observations are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Our distributed algorithm usually produces better results than the $2$-approximation
algorithm of~\cite{Aggarwal06achievinganonymity}.
\item The distributed algorithm runs faster and therefore can be run on larger datasets
\item The results (maximum cluster diameters) are close to the lower bound of $d_{r}^{\max}$.
\end{itemize}

Figure~\ref{fig:comparison} shows the performance of our algorithm in comparison
to~\cite{Aggarwal06achievinganonymity} and $d_{r}^{\max}$ as a baseline, on a snapshot containing
$60$ random users from the dataset. 



The distributed algorithm clearly performs better than~\cite{Aggarwal06achievinganonymity} in
most cases, and in fact performs close to the lower bound.

Figure~\ref{fig:large} shows results on a larger dataset of 1500
mobile users where the distributed still performs well.
