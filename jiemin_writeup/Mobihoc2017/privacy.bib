	Abstract = {<p>In 1977 Dalenius articulated a desideratum for statistical databases: nothing
                about an individual should be learnable from the database that cannot be learned
                without access to the database. We give a general impossibility result showing
                that a formalization of Dalenius' goal along the lines of semantic security
                cannot be achieved. Contrary to intuition, a variant of the result threatens the
                privacy even of someone not in the database. This state of affairs suggests a new
                measure, differential privacy, which, intuitively, captures the increased risk to
                one's privacy incurred by participating in a database. The techniques developed
                in a sequence of papers [8, 13, 3], culminating in those described in [12], can
                achieve any desired level of privacy under this measure. In many cases, extremely
                accurate information about the database can be provided while simultaneously
                ensuring very high levels of privacy.</p>},
