\section{Hardness of Approximation}


For mobile networks and location-based services, the Euclidean plane is a reasonable model for the underlying metric space. In this section, we consider the $r$-gather problem in the Euclidean plane and show lower bounds on approximation even in this special case.  Recall that, in general metric spaces, it is known that it is NP-hard to approximate better than a factor $2$. 

For minimizing the largest diameter of the clusters, we show that it is NP-hard to approximate better than a factor $2$ when $r\geq5$, and that it is NP-hard to approximate better than a factor $\sqrt{2+\sqrt{3}} \approx 1.931$ when $r=3$ or $4$.  (Recall that the diameter of a set is the maximum distance between a pair of points in the set.)

For minimizing the largest of the minimum enclosing balls (MEB) of the clusters, we show that it is NP-hard to approximate better than a factor ${\sqrt{35}+\sqrt{3} \over 4} \approx 1.912$ when $r \geq 4$, and that it is NP-hard to approximate better than a factor $\sqrt{13}/2 \approx 1.802$ when $r=3$.


%For the dual objective of maximizing $r$ given a fixed disk size, we can show the problem is NP-hard to approximate better than $2/3$, using instances in which the optimal $r$ value is 3. Can this be strengthened using instances whose optimal $r$ values are greater?

\begin{theorem} \label{thm:hardness1}
The $r$-gather problem for minimizing the maximum diameter, it is NP-hard to approximate better than a factor of $2$ when $r\geq5$. 
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Our reduction is from the NP-hard problem, planar 3SAT.  Given a formula in 3CNF composed of variables $x_i, i = 1,\dots,n$ and their complements $\overline{x_i}$, we construct an instance of $r$-gather on the plane.  Figure~\ref{fig:3satconstruction} illustrates a clause gadget of the clause $C = x_i \vee x_j \vee x_k$ and part of a variable gadget for $x_i$.  In the figure, each point represents multiple points in the same location, the number of which is noted in parenthesis.  All distances between groups of points connected by a line are distance $1$ apart.  Note that all clusters shown in the figure have a diameter of $1$.  If all clusters have a diameter of $1$, then we can signify the parity of a variable by whether solid or dashed clusters are chosen.  Here the solid clusters signify a positive value for $x_i$ that satisfies the clause since the center point of the clause gadget is successfully assigned to a cluster.  Note that the variable gadget in Figure~\ref{fig:3satconstruction} swaps the parity of the signal sent away from the gadget.  We also include a negation gadget shown in Figure~\ref{fig:negation} that swaps the parity of the signal and can be used when connecting parts of the variable gadget together.  If an optimal solution to this $r$-gather construction can be found, the diameter of all clusters is $1$.

%For the case where $r=3$ or $r = 4$, any clustering that has a cluster with diameter greater than 1 must have a cluster with diameter greater than or equal to $\sqrt{3}$.  A cluster with diameter $\sqrt{3}$ can be found in the clause gadget containing a point from each variable gadget and the center point.  There are no possible clusterings with a diameter greater than 1 or less than $\sqrt{3}$.  Therefore, it is NP-hard to approximate 3-gather and 4-gather better than a factor of $\sqrt{3}$.

%For the case where $r\geq5$, the center point of the clause gadget must be assigned to a cluster that contains all $r$ points of one of the variable clusters or else a cluster of diameter 2 is forced.
The center point of the clause gadget must be assigned to a cluster that contains all $r$ points of one of the variable clusters or else a cluster of diameter $2$ is forced.  Without loss of generality, let the center point be clustered with the $r$ points of the $x_i$ gadget.  What results is the solid clusters in figure~\ref{fig:3satconstruction} are selected above the triangle splitter and the dashed clusters are selected below the splitter.  The group of points at the top of the triangle splitter is unassigned to a cluster.  It must merge with one of the neighboring clusters which results in a cluster of diameter $2$.  Therefore, it is NP-hard to approximate $r$-gather below a factor of $2$ for $r\geq5$.

\begin{theorem}
The $r$-gather problem for minimizing the maximum MEB, it is NP-hard to approximate better than a factor of ${\sqrt{35}+\sqrt{3} \over 4} \approx 1.912$ when $r\geq4$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
The reduction is very simlar to the proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:hardness1}.  The only difference is the splitter which is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:splitter}.

\begin{theorem}
The $r$-gather problem for minimizing the maximum MEB, it is NP-hard to approximate better than a factor of $\sqrt{13}/2 \approx 1.802$ when $r=3$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
We reduce from the NP-hard problem planar circuit SAT.  We are given a planar boolean circuit with a single output.  Similar to the previous proofs, a wire gadget consists of a line of points that alternate between a single point and a group of $r-1$ points at the same location.  The parity of the clusters chosen signify a true signal or a false signal.  When the clusters combine a group of $r-1$ points followed by a single point, the signal of the wire is true.  It is simple to enforce the output to be a true signal by ending the output wire with a single point.  The beginning of the input wires have a group of $r$ points so that the inputs can be either true or false.  Figure~\ref{fig:nandgadget} illustrates the NAND gadget, a universal gate.  The solid clusters illustrate two true inputs into the gate and a false output.  If either or both of the inputs is false, then two groups of points in the triangle (or all three) will become a cluster and the output will be true.  Figure~\ref{fig:splittercircuit} ilustrates the splitter circuit where the solid clusters indicate a true signal and the dashed clusters indicate a false signal.  As before, if the optimal solution to the $r$-gather construction can be found, then cluster diameter will be 1.  Otherwise, three groups will form a cluster, two from the triangle and one adjacent to the triangle.  The diameter of such a cluster is $\sqrt{13}/2 \approx 1.802$ when $r=3$.  Finally, note that in order to connect the wires, they must be able to turn somehow.   We can bend the wire such that no three groups of points can form a cluster that has diameter smaller than $\sqrt{13}/2$.  Thus concludes our proof.
