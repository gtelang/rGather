  abstract = {How do social networks affect the spread of behavior? A popular hypothesis states that networks with many clustered ties and a high degree of separation will be less effective for behavioral diffusion than networks in which locally redundant ties are rewired to provide shortcuts across the social space. A competing hypothesis argues that when behaviors require social reinforcement, a network with more clustering may be more advantageous, even if the network as a whole has a larger diameter. I investigated the effects of network structure on diffusion by studying the spread of health behavior through artificially structured online communities. Individual adoption was much more likely when participants received social reinforcement from multiple neighbors in the social network. The behavior spread farther and faster across clustered-lattice networks than across corresponding random networks.},

    abstract = {This paper considers the model problem of reconstructing an object from incomplete frequency samples. Consider a discrete-time signal f/spl isin/C/sup N/ and a randomly chosen set of frequencies /spl Omega/. Is it possible to reconstruct f from the partial knowledge of its Fourier coefficients on the set /spl Omega/? A typical result of this paper is as follows. Suppose that f is a superposition of |T| spikes f(t)=/spl sigma//sub /spl tau//spl isin/T/f(/spl tau/)/spl delta/(t-/spl tau/) obeying |T|/spl les/C/sub M//spl middot/(log N)/sup -1/ /spl middot/ |/spl Omega/| for some constant C/sub M/>0. We do not know the locations of the spikes nor their amplitudes. Then with probability at least 1-O(N/sup -M/), f can be reconstructed exactly as the solution to the /spl lscr//sub 1/ minimization problem. In short, exact recovery may be obtained by solving a convex optimization problem. We give numerical values for C/sub M/ which depend on the desired probability of success. Our result may be interpreted as a novel kind of nonlinear sampling theorem. In effect, it says that any signal made out of |T| spikes may be recovered by convex programming from almost every set of frequencies of size O(|T|/spl middot/logN). Moreover, this is nearly optimal in the sense that any method succeeding with probability 1-O(N/sup -M/) would in general require a number of frequency samples at least proportional to |T|/spl middot/logN. The methodology extends to a variety of other situations and higher dimensions. For example, we show how one can reconstruct a piecewise constant (one- or two-dimensional) object from incomplete frequency samples - provided that the number of jumps (discontinuities) obeys the condition above - by minimizing other convex functionals such as the total variation of f.},

    abstract = {{<b>Topology control is fundamental to solving</b> <b>scalability and capacity problems in large-scale wireless ad hoc and sensor networks.聽</b>    <p>    Forthcoming wireless multi-hop networks such as ad hoc and sensor networks will allow network nodes to control the communication topology by choosing their transmitting ranges. Briefly, <i>topology control</i> (TC) is the art of co-ordinating nodes\&\#8217; decisions regarding their transmitting ranges, to generate a network with the desired features.聽 Building an optimized network topology helps surpass the prevalent scalability and capacity problems.    <p>    <i>Topology Control in Wireless Ad Hoc and Sensor Networks</i> makes the case for topology control and provides an exhaustive coverage of TC techniques in wireless ad hoc and sensor networks, considering both stationary networks, to which most of the existing solutions are tailored, and mobile networks. The author introduces a new taxonomy of topology control and gives a full explication of the applications and challenges of this important topic.    <p>    <i>Topology Control in Wireless Ad Hoc and Sensor Networks:</i>     <ul>     <li>Defines topology control and explains its necessity, considering both stationary and mobile networks.     <li>Describes the most representative TC protocols and their performance.     <li>Covers the critical transmitting range for stationary and mobile networks, topology optimization problems such as energy efficiency, and distributed topology control.     <li>Discusses implementation and \&\#8216;open issues\&\#8217;, including realistic models and the effect of multi-hop data traffic.     <li>Presents a case study on routing protocol design, to demonstrate how TC can ease the design of cooperative routing protocols.     </ul>    <p>    This invaluable text will provide graduate students in Computer Science, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Applied Mathematics and Physics, researchers in the field of ad hoc networking, and professionals in wireless telecoms as well as networking system developers with a single reference resource on topology control.} {This annual series on organic reaction mechanisms research provides concise, comprehensive coverage of the year's literature as well as discussions of important results, each volume is extensively referenced to previous volumes and primary journals.   This the 37th book in the series will survey research on organic reaction mechanisms described in the literature between December 1999 to November 2000.   As in previous volumes new mechanisms for the synthesis of all types of organic compounds will be included as well as such mechanisms as addition and elimination reactions, nucleophilic and electrophilic aromatic substitutions and molecular arrangements.}},

    abstract = {This paper tackles the problems of localization and coverage in randomly deployed high density sensor networks. In particular, it presents a novel and integrated approach that performs at once localization and coverage. We introduce here an approach based on a single mobile beacon aware of its position. Sensor nodes receiving beacon packets will be able to locate themselves. On the other hand, We exploit the localization phase to construct sets of active nodes that ensure as much as possible the zone coverage. In our approach the mobile beacon follows a Hilbert curve. The results of experiments conducted using the discrete event simulator Omnet++, are discussed, they allow us to justify our approach and to compare it to existing ones.},

abstract ={This paper surveys the use of geometric methods for wireless sensor networks. The close relationship of sensor nodes with their embedded physical space imposes a unique geometric character on such systems. The physical locations of the sensor nodes greatly impact on system design in all aspects, from low-level networking and organization to high-level information processing and applications. This paper reviews work in the past 10 years on topics such as network localization, geometric routing, information discovery, data-centric routing and topology discovery.},

@article{Sweeney02,
    abstract = {Consider a data holder, such as a hospital or a bank, that has a privately held collection of person-specific, field structured data. Suppose the data holder wants to share a version of the data with researchers. How can a data holder release a version of its private data with scientific guarantees that the individuals who are the subjects of the data cannot be re-identified while the data remain practically useful? The solution provided in this paper includes a formal protection model named k-anonymity and a set of accompanying policies for deployment. A release provides k-anonymity protection if the information for each person contained in the release cannot be distinguished from at least k-1 individuals whose information also appears in the release. This paper also examines re-identification attacks that can be realized on releases that adhere to k- anonymity unless accompanying policies are respected. The k-anonymity protection model is important because it forms the basis on which the real-world systems known as Datafly, {碌-Argus} and {k-Similar} provide guarantees of privacy protection.},

@article{Rapoport1953TriadicClosure,
    abstract = {{Abstract聽聽A previously derived iteration formula for a random net was applied to some data on the spread of information through a population. It was found that if the axon density (the only free parameter in the formula) is determined by the first pair of experimental values, the predicted spread is much more rapid than the observed one. If the successive values of the  鈥?apparent axon density鈥?are calculated from the successive experimental values, it is noticed that this quantity at first suffers a sharp drop from an initial high value to its lowest value and then gradually  鈥?recovers鈥? An attempt is made to account for this behavior of the apparent axon density in terms of the  鈥?assumption of transitivity鈥? based on a certain socio-structural bias, namely, that the likely contacts of two individuals who themselves have been in contact are expected to be strongly overlapping. The assumption of transitivity leads to a drop in the apparent axon density from an arbitrary initial value to the vicinity of unity (if the actual axon density is not too small). However, the  鈥?recovery鈥?is not accounted for, and thus the predicted spread turns out to beslower than the observed.}},

    abstract = {{Bootstrap percolation (BP) models are systems where sites are initially randomly occupied. Those sites that do not maintain a suitable local environment of occupied sites are successively removed. This culling process can be identified with a cellular automation. Variations of the local rules concerning suitable environments, lead to different families of models, which have members with percolation transitions of the usual type, as well as representatives undergo different types of first order transitions. The latter transitions are manifestations of longer ranged phenomena in the systems. In this review different families of the BP type are introduced and their relationships summarized. The finite-size effects observed near the first order transitions are also discussed. Recent exact and numerical results are presented, and some applications and open problems are outlined.}},

  abstract={A new percolation problem is posed which can exhibit a first-order transition. In bootstrap percolation, sites on an empty lattice are first randomly occupied, and then all occupied sites with less than a given number m of occupied neighbours are successively removed until a stable configuration is reached. On any lattice for sufficiently large m, the ensuing clusters can only be infinite. On a Bethe lattice for m>or=3, the fraction of the lattice occupied by infinite clusters discontinuously jumps from zero at the percolation threshold. From an analysis of stable and metastable ground states of the dilute Blume-Capel model (1966), it is concluded that effects like bootstrap percolation may occur in some real magnets.}

Non-random networks have long paths, and big local clusters, where clustering is defined as the number of your friends that are each others' friends. Random networks have short paths, and small local clustering. Randomness made by increasing probability "p" of adding random edges to a regular graph. However: if p increases to 0.01, you very quickly (knee) get short path lengths, but clusters remain biggish until about p=0.3 or 0.4. Reason is the existence of well-connected nodes that keep paths small},

This article investigates how firms (and governments) can harness the power of social networks to promote their goals. We show that the optimal use of social networks leads to higher sales and greater profits. However, an increase in the level and dispersion of social interaction can increase or decrease the optimal influence strategy and profits of the player, depending on the <roman>content</roman> of the interaction. Optimal influence strategies will target individuals with low or high connections, depending on the content of interaction. Finally, the returns to investing in market research on social networks are greater in more unequal networks. Copyright (c) 2009, RAND..},

abstract ={A number of recent studies have focused on the statistical properties of networked systems such as social networks and the Worldwide Web. Researchers have concentrated particularly on a few properties that seem to be common to many networks: the small-world property, power-law degree distributions, and network transitivity. In this article, we highlight another property that is found in many networks, the property of community structure, in which network nodes are joined together in tightly knit groups, between which there are only looser connections. We propose a method for detecting such communities, built around the idea of using centrality indices to find community boundaries. We test our method on computer-generated and real-world graphs whose community structure is already known and find that the method detects this known structure with high sensitivity and reliability. We also apply the method to two networks whose community structure is not well known鈥攁 collaboration network and a food web鈥攁nd find that it detects significant and informative community divisions in both cases.},

@article{gonzalez08mobility,
    abstract = {{Despite their importance for urban planning1, traffic forecasting2 and the spread of biological3, 4, 5 and mobile viruses6, our understanding of the basic laws governing human motion remains limited owing to the lack of tools to monitor the time-resolved location of individuals. Here we study the trajectory of 100,000 anonymized mobile phone users whose position is tracked for a six-month period. We find that, in contrast with the random trajectories predicted by the prevailing L\'{e}vy flight and random walk models7, human trajectories show a high degree of temporal and spatial regularity, each individual being characterized by a time-independent characteristic travel distance and a significant probability to return to a few highly frequented locations. After correcting for differences in travel distances and the inherent anisotropy of each trajectory, the individual travel patterns collapse into a single spatial probability distribution, indicating that, despite the diversity of their travel history, humans follow simple reproducible patterns. This inherent similarity in travel patterns could impact all phenomena driven by human mobility, from epidemic prevention to emergency response, urban planning and agent-based modelling.}},

@article{Brockmann:2006:Nature:16437114,
  abstract = {The dynamic spatial redistribution of individuals is a key driving force of various spatiotemporal phenomena on geographical scales. It can synchronize populations of interacting species, stabilize them, and diversify gene pools. Human travel, for example, is responsible for the geographical spread of human infectious disease. In the light of increasing international trade, intensified human mobility and the imminent threat of an influenza A epidemic, the knowledge of dynamical and statistical properties of human travel is of fundamental importance. Despite its crucial role, a quantitative assessment of these properties on geographical scales remains elusive, and the assumption that humans disperse diffusively still prevails in models. Here we report on a solid and quantitative assessment of human travelling statistics by analysing the circulation of bank notes in the United States. Using a comprehensive data set of over a million individual displacements, we find that dispersal is anomalous in two ways. First, the distribution of travelling distances decays as a power law, indicating that trajectories of bank notes are reminiscent of scale-free random walks known as L\{\'e\}vy flights. Second, the probability of remaining in a small, spatially confined region for a time T is dominated by algebraically long tails that attenuate the superdiffusive spread. We show that human travelling behaviour can be described mathematically on many spatiotemporal scales by a two-parameter continuous-time random walk model to a surprising accuracy, and conclude that human travel on geographical scales is an ambivalent and effectively superdiffusive process.},

  abstract={The rate at which nodes in a network increase their connectivity depends on their fitness to compete for links. For example, in social networks some individuals acquire more social links than others, or on the www some webpages attract considerably more links than others. We find that this competition for links translates into multiscaling, i.e. a fitness-dependent dynamic exponent, allowing fitter nodes to overcome the more connected but less fit ones. Uncovering this fitter-gets-richer phenomenon can help us understand in quantitative terms the evolution of many competitive systems in nature and society.}

It combines good worst case complexity, fast behavior on real data, small memory occupation and the possibility of fully dynamic insertions and deletions. The location structure is organized into several levels. The lowest level just consists of the triangulation, then each level contains the triangulation of a small sample of the level below. Point location is done by walking in a triangulation to determine the nearest neighbor of the query at that level, then the walk restarts from that neighbor at the level below. Using a small subset (3\%) to sample a level allows a small memory occupation; the walk and the use of the nearest neighbor to change levels quickly locate the query.}},

This article investigates how firms (and governments) can harness the power of social networks to promote their goals. We show that the optimal use of social networks leads to higher sales and greater profits. However, an increase in the level and dispersion of social interaction can increase or decrease the optimal influence strategy and profits of the player, depending on the <roman>content</roman> of the interaction. Optimal influence strategies will target individuals with low or high connections, depending on the content of interaction. Finally, the returns to investing in market research on social networks are greater in more unequal networks. Copyright (c) 2009, RAND..},

abstract ={Experimentally determined networks are susceptible to errors, yet important inferences can still be drawn from them. Many real networks have also been shown to have the small-world network properties of cohesive neighborhoods and short average distances between vertices. Although much analysis has been done on small-world networks, small-world properties have not previously been used to improve our understanding of individual edges in experimentally derived graphs. Here we focus on a small-world network derived from high-throughput (and error-prone) protein–protein interaction experiments. We exploit the neighborhood cohesiveness property of small-world networks to assess confidence for individual protein–protein interactions. By ascertaining how well each protein–protein interaction (edge) fits the pattern of a small-world network, we stratify even those edges with identical experimental evidence. This result promises to improve the quality of inference from protein–protein interaction networks in particular and small-world networks in general.},

  abstract = {Social network analysis has attracted much attention in recent years. Link prediction is a key research direction within this area. In this paper, we study link prediction as a supervised learning task. Along the way, we identify a set of features that are key to the performance under the supervised learning setup. The identified features are very easy to compute, and at the same time surprisingly e#ective in solving the link prediction problem. We also explain the e#ectiveness of the features from their class density distribution. Then we compare di#erent classes of supervised learning algorithms in terms of their prediction performance using various performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision-recall, F-values, squared error etc. with a 5-fold cross validation. Our results on two practical social network datasets shows that most of the well-known classification algorithms (decision tree, k-NN, multilayer perceptron, SVM, RBF network) can predict links with comparable performances, but SVM outperforms all of them with narrow margin in all performance measures. Again, ranking of features with popular feature ranking algorithms shows that a small subset of features always plays a significant role in link prediction.},

  abstract={ The growth of the Internet and assorted technologies has made it possible to collect and process detailed information on social networks. This article investigates how firms (and governments) can harness the power of social networks to promote their goals. We show that the optimal use of social networks leads to higher sales and greater profits. However, an increase in the level and dispersion of social interaction can increase or decrease the optimal influence strategy and profits of the player, depending on the <roman>content</roman> of the interaction. Optimal influence strategies will target individuals with low or high connections, depending on the content of interaction. Finally, the returns to investing in market research on social networks are greater in more unequal networks. Copyright (c) 2009, RAND..},

abstract ={Our enhanced ability to map the structure of various complex networks is increasingly accompanied by the possibility of independently identifying the functional characteristics of each node. Although this led to the observation that nodes with similar characteristics have a tendency to link to each other, in general we lack the tools to quantify the interplay between node properties and the structure of the underlying network. Here we show that when nodes in a network belong to two distinct classes, two independent parameters are needed to capture the detailed interplay between the network structure and node properties. We find that the network structure significantly limits the values of these parameters, requiring a phase diagram to uniquely characterize the configurations available to the system. The phase diagram shows a remarkable independence from the network size, a finding that, together with a proposed heuristic algorithm, allows us to determine its shape even for large networks. To test the usefulness of the developed methods, we apply them to biological and socioeconomic systems, finding that protein functions and mobile phone usage occupy distinct regions of the phase diagram, indicating that the proposed parameters have a strong discriminating power.},

abstract ={Hit songs, books, and movies are many times more successful than average, suggesting that “the best” alternatives are qualitatively different from “the rest”; yet experts routinely fail to predict which products will succeed. We investigated this paradox experimentally, by creating an artificial “music market” in which 14,341 participants downloaded previously unknown songs either with or without knowledge of previous participants' choices. Increasing the strength of social influence increased both inequality and unpredictability of success. Success was also only partly determined by quality: The best songs rarely did poorly, and the worst rarely did well, but any other result was possible.},

year = {2009},
doi = {10.1073/pnas.0908800106},
abstract ={Node characteristics and behaviors are often correlated with the structure of social networks over time. While evidence of this type of assortative mixing and temporal clustering of behaviors among linked nodes is used to support claims of peer influence and social contagion in networks, homophily may also explain such evidence. Here we develop a dynamic matched sample estimation framework to distinguish influence and homophily effects in dynamic networks, and we apply this framework to a global instant messaging network of 27.4 million users, using data on the day-by-day adoption of a mobile service application and users' longitudinal behavioral, demographic, and geographic data. We find that previous methods overestimate peer influence in product adoption decisions in this network by 300ñ700%, and that homophily explains >50% of the perceived behavioral contagion. These findings and methods are essential to both our understanding of the mechanisms that drive contagions in networks and our knowledge of how to propagate or combat them in domains as diverse as epidemiology, marketing, development economics, and public health.},

@Inproceedings {export:119088,
abstract     = {<p>With the increasing popularity of location-based services, such as tour guide
                and location-based social network, we now have accumulated many location data on
                the Web. In this paper, we show that, by using the location data based on GPS and
                users’ comments at various locations, we can discover interesting locations and
                possible activities that can be performed there for recommendations. Our research
                is highlighted in the following location-related queries in our daily life: 1) if
                we want to do something such as sightseeing or food-hunting in a large city such
                as Beijing, where should we go? 2) If we have already visited some places such as
                the Bird’s Nest building in Beijing’s Olympic park, what else can we do there? By
                using our system, for the first question, we can recommend her to visit a list of
                interesting locations such as Tiananmen Square, Bird’s Nest, etc. For the second
                question, if the user visits Bird’s Nest, we can recommend her to not only do
                sightseeing but also to experience its outdoor exercise facilities or try some
                nice food nearby. To achieve this goal, we first model the users’ location and
                activity histories that we take as input. We then mine knowledge, such as the
                location features and activity-activity correlations from the geographical
                databases and the Web, to gather additional inputs. Finally, we apply a
                collective matrix factorization method to mine interesting locations and
                activities, and use them to recommend to the users where they can visit if they
                want to perform some specific activities and what they can do if they visit some
                specific places. We empirically evaluated our system using a large GPS dataset
                collected by 162 users over a period of 2.5 years in the real-world. We
                extensively evaluated our system and showed that our system can outperform
                several state-of-the-art baselines.</p>},

  abstract = {A range of applications, from predicting the spread of human and electronic viruses to city planning and resource management in mobile communications, depend on our ability to foresee the whereabouts and mobility of individuals, raising a fundamental question: To what degree is human behavior predictable? Here we explore the limits of predictability in human dynamics by studying the mobility patterns of anonymized mobile phone users. By measuring the entropy of each individual's trajectory, we find a 93% potential predictability in user mobility across the whole user base. Despite the significant differences in the travel patterns, we find a remarkable lack of variability in predictability, which is largely independent of the distance users cover on a regular basis.

Human mobility is differentiated by time scales. While the mechanism for long time scales has been studied, the underlying mechanism on the daily scale is still unrevealed. Here, we uncover the mechanism responsible for the daily mobility patterns by analysing the temporal and spatial trajectories of thousands of persons as individual networks. Using the concept of motifs from network theory, we find only 17 unique networks are present in daily mobility and they follow simple rules. These networks, called here motifs, are sufficient to capture up to 90 per cent of the population in surveys and mobile phone datasets for different countries. Each individual exhibits a characteristic motif, which seems to be stable over several months. Consequently, daily human mobility can be reproduced by an analytically tractable framework for Markov chains by modelling periods of high-frequency trips followed by periods of lower activity as the key ingredient.

This paper compares observational data from mobile phones with standard self-report survey data. We find that the information from these two data sources is overlapping but distinct. For example, self-reports of physical proximity deviate from mobile phone records depending on the recency and salience of the interactions. We also demonstrate that it is possible to accurately infer 95% of friendships based on the observational data alone, where friend dyads demonstrate distinctive temporal and spatial patterns in their physical proximity and calling patterns. These behavioral patterns, in turn, allow the prediction of individual-level outcomes such as job satisfaction.},

   abstract    = {Vehicular Networks (VNs) seek to provide, among other
                 applications, safer driving conditions. To do so,
                 vehicles need to periodically broadcast safety messages
                 providing precise position information to nearby
                 vehicles. However, this frequent messaging (e.g., every
                 100 to 300ms per car) greatly facilitates the tracking of
                 vehicles, as it suffices to eavesdrop the wireless
                 medium. As a result, the drivers privacy is at stake. In
                 order to mitigate this threat, while complying with the
                 safety requirements of VNs, we suggest the creation of
                 mix-zones at appropriate places of the VN. We propose to
                 do so with the use of cryptography, and study
                 analytically how the combination of mix-zones into
                 mix-networks brings forth location privacy in VNs.
                 Finally, we show by simulations that the proposed mix
                 system is effective in various scenarios.},
