=======================================
What does it mean to make an animation? 
=======================================

1. The same thing you have done. Except that you improve the visual appearance of your animation. 
   Don't do that gif thing of restarting everything when the end has-reached. The media player on 
   the appropriate platform can do that. 

2. To the animation video, pass command-line parameters indicating framerate, blitting/noblitting and other goodness.
   including the type of video format to save it to. Make sure that the video is really relally high-quality. 
   Max out your GPU in rendering the video. Don't spare anything here.
   
   It is important to learn the tool ffmpeg. Understood the tool properly.
