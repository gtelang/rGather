What does it mean to make an animation? 

1. The same thing you have done. Except that you improve the visual appearance of your animation. 
   Don't do that gif thing of restarting everything when the end has-reached. The media player on 
   the appropriate platform can do that. 

2. To the animation video, pass command-line parameters indicating framerate, blitting/noblitting and other goodness.
