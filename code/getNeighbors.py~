# In the paper we show that the 2-approximation rGather problem applies to
# trajectory data with zero regroupings. When we allow  max of k regroupings
# there is a nice, Dyanmic programming algorithm which we also implement.
# The MATLAB file provided by Prof. Gao can be thought of like an Excel sheet:
# The columns corresponds to cars, and rows corresponds to time.
# Each entry in the matrix, contains a tuple of x-y coordinates correponding to
# the positions of taxi-cabs in the R2 plane.
# As a mnemonic think 'c' for columns/cars and 'r' for rows/record. incase you
# forget. For the most part you will be focusing only on a submatrix of the
# full matrix. (Can we use some funky ideas related to core-sets on matrics I had seen before?)
# Since you will be using the 2Approx metric space algorithm at least for the case of zero regroupings
# each column correponds to a point in the metric spoce. Clearly, you will have to use list-slicing
# in this case. Just make note of that!!!!

# Things to do
# Make the findNearestNeighborSearch in base class depend on both the 2R and the k nearest neighbors via options.
# Given kwarg arguments.
# Ensure that brute force search is kept.
