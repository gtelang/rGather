- [X] Make a function to read the YAML files you wrote out. For that will be critical.  
- [X] Make a sanity check of the codes for the TSPLIB data-sets which you ran: Berlin 52.
- [X] Check the tex files compile on your computer.   



FINISH THE FOLLOWING THIS BY 11.30 AM
- [X] Give a rough glance over the code. for a morning sanity check. 
- [X] Change neighbour search for 2-Approximation. Overriding in subclass for R2L2. 
      Will be important for large case, where I want it to work. 
- [X] Rik's suggestion for Max independent Set which might give very good results. 



- [x] Extract data from the trajectories at times [144] This is afternoon time.  
        200, 400..,4000 cars. For this you will straightaway select the first so many columns. No rubbish here.  
        Write them to a file: TSPLIB style. i.e. just the X-Y coordinates. 
        N200.txt, N400.txt, N600.txt, .... N4000.txt

  - [ ] Begin comparison
      We will fix our attention on the 144 th row of the table. 
      For this consider a fixed number of cars say 2000 cars. 
      and then do the analysis for just this file. This is a sufficiently large data-set on which to do data-analysis
      Do r=20,40,...,500 [ 25 values of r, which increases the cluster size. Smaller the r, lesser the privacy ] 
      Just get the damned clusters first into YAML files. 
 
    - [ ] Start generating plots here:!!!!
          See the whiteboard for such plots. All plots eps.

After which you can just keep writing away.Including all the plots and 
what not. Joe and Jie will help.

Things to do <2016-07-30 Sat> 


- [ ] What is longitude and latitude?

- [ ] Learn how to make your matplotlib figures prettier. 
     These should be double-checked against the 
     - [ ] Latex
     - [ ] Legends
     - [ ] Text annotations.
     - [ ] Grid should be on
     - [ ] Fix font size on 
         - [ ] xaxis
         - [ ] yaxis
         - [ ] Title. This should be a good explanatory title and a good font-size.  

- [ ] Go quickly through the Aggarwal paper, about their radius claim 
- [ ] Go over your implementation of the Aggarwal paper again. This is a sanity check
- [ ] Implement the recursive scheme to improve their solutions, for obviously you will 
      get better results. Next: Take the best over --- 10 iterations? This should not take 
      too much longer if you will be testing r upto 15. Each recursive step is fast enough
      for a set of size 60, since we will take r = N/4



-[ ] There should be a folder which will contain the final code, used 
     for generating the results. For it will be "frozen-in-time" to document all the decisions
     that you made. 
     - [ ] You should make a copy of the Literate Folder -- not just the code itself. 
           For that is what provides the map. I will remove the .html file since it is  
           not necessary. 
      -[ ] Thus the YAML files, will also be distributed with the code results. 
      -[ ] Make a small file in which is a README file for  
           1. Generating new data-set by running it against a given set of coordinates. [xy, geographical corrdinates assume]
           2. Analysing  new data-set and tell where the plots are produced. 
           3. Using the GUI scripts for interacting with the code live. You might want to mention you wrote the GUI, 
              and say it is available at so and so. The code could be hosted on Joe/Jie/Rik's website wherever. 
      -[ ] The README file is more for your co-authors than for anyone else. To play with the code. 



- [ ] We need to make more data. 
      - [ ] TSPLIB data-set: As a backup, in case Jiaxin does not reply, 
              do this for the EUC2D file. 
              - berlin52 : For comparison of the algorithms. 
              - Large file d1655, d657. 
      - [ ] Implement  new distance function for coordinates given in longitude and latitude. 
            This should not be too difficult to do. 

- [ ] Possible data to be computed in a post-hoc analysis once we have the yaml files
      from the final final final data. 
        1. Histogram of the number of points per cluster (Jbig)
        2  Max, 90p, maxrnearest (Jbig)
        3. Max, 90p, maxrnearest (JAsmall)
        4. Max, 90p, maxrnearest (JAsmall)
