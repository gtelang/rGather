- [X] A sample file
- [X] Add this file generation code to rGatherProgram.org
- [ ] Read the table from the sample file in the constructor
- [ ] Can the table generation be done within the constructor itself? 
      Will make life much simpler, since the tables are relatively easy to 
      generate. What takes time is writing to disk.
 
---------
Workflow:
---------

- [X] Both table option, and within constructor table construction is supported
- [X] Fix rangeSearch and findNearestNeighbors, by making use of the table just constructed. 
      This way there is no need to write files, and make files for different sample numbers!!
 
- [ ] Recursion  , to improve solution quality. The random choices affect the output.
- [ ] Regroupings, dynamic program
- [ ] Rendering  , animate the sequences, and the trajectory groupings. 
      possibly, one all same colors/completely different colors,
- [ ] Threading, and then run it on 4-core computer.!!!
